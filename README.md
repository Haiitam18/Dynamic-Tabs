# Simple Tabs Project

## Description

The **Simple Tabs** project provides a basic and clean implementation of tab navigation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to easily switch between different content sections by clicking on tab labels. This is a lightweight solution for managing multiple content views on a webpage.

## Features

- **Four tabs**: Switch between four different content sections.
- **Responsive**: The tab navigation is responsive, ensuring a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **No external libraries**: The project is built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into any project.

## How It Works

This project uses the `<input type="radio">` element in HTML to handle the tab switching. Each tab is associated with a radio button that controls the visibility of the content below. When a tab is clicked, the content related to that tab is displayed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haiitam18/Dynamic-Tabs.git
